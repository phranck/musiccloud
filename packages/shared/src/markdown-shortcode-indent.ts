/**
 * @file How deeply a position sits inside the containers above it.
 *
 * A container is written `[[card { … }]]`, so its braces carry the structure of
 * the document and an editor can offer the right indentation for the next line.
 * This module answers that one question and knows nothing about editors.
 *
 * It reads lines rather than parsing, because it has to answer whilst the text
 * is half-written: the line that opened a container is there, the line that
 * closes it is not yet, and no parser makes sense of that. Counting is what
 * works on a document somebody is still typing.
 *
 * It answers for two moments only and leaves every other one alone. Those two
 * are the ones an editor cannot work out on its own: the line after a container
 * opens, which has to step in, and the line that closes one, which has to step
 * back out. Everywhere else it returns `null`, so Markdown's own rules keep
 * deciding, and a list inside a container indents the way a list does.
